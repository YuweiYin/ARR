      "cot_content": "A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.\nWe use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \\Rightarrow\\left[s^{\\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d t}[\\ln (s-2)]=\\frac{s^{\\prime}}{s-2}=\\frac{-1}{25}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left[-\\frac{t}{25}ight] .\n$$\nChoose $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \\cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (I).",

      "cot": "To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the properties of a stationary autoregressive (AR) process. A stationary autoregressive process is one where the time series is mean-reverting, and its statistical properties do not change over time. Additionally, the effects of shocks in such a process are temporary.\n\nLet's review each answer choice:\n\n(A) Never occur - Shocks can and do occur in autoregressive processes; this option is incorrect.\n\n(B) Persist indefinitely - In a stationary AR process, shocks do not persist indefinitely; this is incorrect.\n\n(C) Cause a permanent change in the trend - For a process to be stationary, shocks cannot cause a permanent change; this is incorrect.\n\n(D) Grow exponentially - In a stationary AR process, shocks do not grow exponentially; this is incorrect.\n\n(E) Only affect the next period - Shocks in an AR process typically affect more than one period; this option is incorrect.\n\n(F) Eventually die away - This is the key characteristic of a stationary process. Shocks will gradually lose their influence and the process returns to its mean. This is the correct description of what happens in a stationary AR process.\n\n(G) Cause the process to become non-stationary - Shocks do not cause a stationary process to become non-stationary; this option is incorrect.\n\n(H) Immediately disappear - Shocks do not disappear immediately; their effects decay over time, but not instantaneously.

      "arr": "To determine how shocks affect a stationary autoregressive (AR) process, we first need to understand the properties of such a process.\n\n### Understanding Stationary Autoregressive Processes\n\n1. **Stationarity**: A stationary process is one whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocovariance, do not change over time. For an AR process to be stationary, the roots of its characteristic equation must lie outside the unit circle.\n\n2. **Autoregressive Process**: In an AR process, the current value of the series is a linear function of its previous values and a random shock (or error term). For example, an AR(1) process is structured as:\n   \\[\n   X_t = \\phi X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\n   \\]\n   where \\( |\\phi| < 1 \\) for stationarity.\n\n### Characteristics of Shocks in Stationary AR Processes\n\n- **Persistence of Shocks**: In a stationary AR process, any shock (or error term) will have an effect that diminishes over time. The key point is that the impact of a shock *decays* as it propagates through the system due to the stationarity condition (e.g., \\( |\\phi| < 1 \\) in AR(1)).\n\n- **Eventual Die-Out**: Since shocks have a lessening effect over future periods (because the coefficients are such that \\( |\\phi| < 1 \\)), they eventually die away. This characteristic differentiates stationary processes from non-stationary ones, where shocks could have lasting effects.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\nWith this understanding, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) Never occur - This is incorrect as shocks are a fundamental component of AR processes and occur constantly as white noise.\n\n(B) Persist indefinitely - Incorrect for a stationary process; shocks do not persist forever.\n\n(C) Cause a permanent change in the trend - Incorrect for a stationary process as it would imply non-stationarity.\n\n(D) Grow exponentially - Incorrect because the effect of shocks diminishes, not grows in stationary processes.\n\n(E) Only affect the next period - Incorrect, as the effect is not limited to just one period, but diminishes over many periods.\n\n(F) Eventually die away - Correct, because in stationary processes, the impact of shocks diminishes over time.\n\n(G) Cause the process to become non-stationary - Incorrect because a stationary process remains stationary despite shocks.\n\n(H) Immediately disappear - Incorrect as the effect of shocks fades gradually over time, not immediately.\n\n(I) Lead to a cyclical pattern - Incorrect as shocks cause deviations, not cycles.\n\n(J) Be balanced out by subsequent shocks - Incorrect in terms of individual shock effects; subsequent shocks are independent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is (F) Eventually die away. This reflects the property of stationary autoregressive processes where the effects of shocks diminish over time, aligning with the conditions for stationarity in such models."

While refraction plays a role in how light interacts with the thin film of a bubble, it's not the direct cause of the colors.\n\n(D) **Reflection:** This is the bouncing back of light from a surface. While necessary for colors to be seen, reflection by itself doesn't explain the color patterns.\n\n(E) **Interference:** This refers to the phenomenon where two or more waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude.

This occurs in a prism but is not the primary cause for colors in a soap bubble.\n\n2. **Deflection** (B): This is a general term for a change in direction, such as scattering, but it is not directly responsible for the colors in a soap bubble.\n\n3. **Refraction** (C): This is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another. Although refraction occurs in bubbles, it does not by itself explain the colors.\n\n4. **Reflection** (D): Light does reflect off the surfaces of a soap bubble, but reflection alone (like in a mirror) does not produce colors.\n\n5. **Interference** (E): This is when waves overlap, leading to constructive and destructive interference patterns. The soap bubble's colors are primarily due to thin-film interference, where light waves reflected off the outer and inner surfaces of the soap film interfere with each other, enhancing or canceling specific wavelengths (colors).\n\n6. **Converted to a different frequency** (F): Light does not typically undergo a change in frequency in soap bubbles.\n\n7. **Polarization** (G): This involves the alignment of light waves in a particular direction and does not directly cause the colors in a bubble.\n\n8. **Absorption** (H): This is when light is absorbed and not re-emitted; while the bubble material may absorb some light, it doesn't explain the vivid colors seen.\n\n9. **Diffraction** (I): This involves bending of light around corners and edges and can contribute to scattering, but it is not the primary cause of colors in soap bubbles.\n\n10. **Transmission** (J): This is light passing through a material, and while it occurs, it doesn't explain the colors themselves.\n\nThe primary cause of the vibrant colors observed in soap bubbles is **interference** of light waves. The thin film of the bubble has microscopic variations in thickness, causing different wavelengths (colors) to interfere constructively or destructively based on the film's thickness and the light's angle of incidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(E) interference."

Non-alignment was a direct response to Cold War dynamics.\n\n5. **Decolonization (E):** This is directly relevant to the passage, as it discusses neo-colonialism, a concept closely related to newly independent states trying to assert control post-colonization.\n\n6. **World War II (F):** While it played a part in leading to decolonization, it is not as directly related to the specific themes in the passage as decolonization.\n\n7. **Autarky (G):** This refers to a state's economic self-sufficiency and doesn't directly relate to the themes of Nkrumah's writings about neo-colonialism and foreign investment.\n\n8. **The rise of multinational corporations (H):** While connected to economic control, the primary focus of the passage is on the political power balance, not directly on corporations.\n\n9. **The American Civil Rights Movement (I):** This is a domestic issue in the United States and not related to the wider international themes and context of Nkrumah's discussion.\n\n10. **Regional Free Trade Associations (J):** These are more recent economic collaborations and do not directly align with the historical context of the 1960s.\n\nUpon consideration, the best context for Nkrumah's writings would be **(E) Decolonization**, as it specifically addresses the issues of newly independent countries dealing with economic and political challenges of neo-colonialism.",
      "arr": "To determine the best context for Kwame Nkrumah's writings on neo-colonialism, let's first analyze the content and timeframe of his statement.\n\n1. **Content**: Nkrumah discusses \"neo-colonialism,\" which refers to a form of indirect control where developed countries influence less developed regions, often through economic means, rather than direct political control. He mentions non-alignment, which implies not taking sides with major power blocs (capitalist or socialist) during a time when such divisions were prominent.\n\n2. **Timeframe**: The passage was written in 1965. This era was characterized by several significant global developments:\n   - Many African and Asian countries were gaining independence from colonial rule, a process known as **decolonization**.\n   - The **Cold War** was ongoing, with developing countries often being pressured to align with either the United States (capitalist bloc) or the Soviet Union (socialist bloc).\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) The spread of communism**: While communism was a significant global theme, the passage focuses on neo-colonialism and economic independence more than ideological expansion.\n- **(B) The Industrial Revolution**: This occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries and is not directly related to the context of Nkrumah's writings.\n- **(C) The French Revolution**: This took place in the late 18th century and is unrelated to the content of the passage.\n- **(D) The Cold War**: This provides a relevant context as it affected global alignments. However, Nkrumah emphasizes economic independence and the national interests of decolonizing states.\n- **(E) Decolonization**: This is highly relevant as it refers to the period when many countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, were gaining independence and focused on breaking free from former colonial powers' economic controls.\n- **(F) World War II**: This set the stage for widespread decolonization but is not directly the context of Nkrumah's writings in 1965.\n- **(G) Autarky**: Self-sufficiency in economics does not match the notion of cooperation with \"capitalist, socialist, or mixed economy\" states mentioned in the passage.\n- **(H) The rise of multinational corporations**: While relevant to economic control, the passage focuses more on political independence through economic means.\n- **(I) The American Civil Rights Movement**: Although contemporaneous, it is primarily a domestic issue in the United States.\n- **(J) Regional Free Trade Associations**: These are economic arrangements and do not directly relate to the independence themes present here.\n\nBased on the discussion above, the best context for Nkrumah's writings on neo-colonialism is most directly related to **(E) Decolonization**. This theme fits the focus on achieving true independence and controlling economic influence during the period after many countries gained political sovereignty."
